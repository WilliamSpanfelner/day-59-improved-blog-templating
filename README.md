- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  
- 🧑‍💻 The upgraded blog template employs Bootstrap styling. Flask allows the site to be hosted locally and Jinja allows the passing of information and the use of Python for templating purposes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
